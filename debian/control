Description: Authenticate using SSH keys
 This pluggable authentication module (PAM) provides single sign-on
 using secure shell (SSH) keys.  During authentication, the user types
 a SSH passphrase and is authenticated if the passphrase successfully
 decrypts the user's SSH private keys.  In the PAM session phase, an
 ssh-agent process is started and decrypted keys are added, and thus
 the user can SSH to other hosts that accept key authentication
 without typing more passwords for the entire session.
