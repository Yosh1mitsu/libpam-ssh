This PAM module provides single sign-on behavior for SSH.  The user
types an SSH passphrase when logging in (probably to GDM, KDM, or XDM)
and is authenticated if the passphrase successfully decrypts the
user's SSH private key.  In the PAM session phase, an ssh-agent
process is started and keys are added.  For the entire session, the
user can SSH to other hosts that accept key authentication without
typing any passwords.
